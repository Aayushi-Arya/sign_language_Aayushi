# 🤟 Sign Language Recognition using YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time **American Sign Language (ASL)** alphabet recognition system using the **YOLOv8** object detection model. It includes custom dataset collection, model training, and real-time detection using a webcam.

---

## 🎯 Project Highlights

- 🔤 Recognizes ASL alphabets A–Z using object detection.
- 📸 Collected a custom dataset using OpenCV and Jupyter.
- 🧠 Trained YOLOv8n model on labeled image data.
- 💡 Achieved accurate real-time predictions using lightweight YOLOv8 architecture.
- 🖥️ Built for educational, accessibility, and assistive tech purposes.
